# Smart Contract Deployment and Interaction

This is a guide that could be followed to build Solidity smart contracts and interact with them.


## AlChemy Tutorials: Creating and Interacting with Smart Contracts

Learn how to create and interact with a smart contract using Alchemy:

### Hello World Contract
- [Hello World Smart Contract](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/hello-world-smart-contract)

#### Topics
- Alchemy Composer Tool for invoking some methods on blockchain explorer
- Install Node.js/npm, Hardhat (has ethers.js) for smart contract development

- Build and deploy a simple "Hello World" smart contract using Hardhat:
   - Develop the contract in Solidity
   - dotenv, metamask setup, metamask private key and AlChemy API key
   - Deploy the contract on a local or test Ethereum network 
   - Interact with the deployed smart contract
   - Submit the smart contract to Etherscan for verification

### Storage, Memory, and Calldata
### Events in Solidity
### Mapping and Arrays in Solidity
