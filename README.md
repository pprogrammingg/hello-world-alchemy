# Smart Contract Deployment and Interaction

This is a guide that could be followed to build Solidity smart contracts and interact with them.


## AlChemy Tutorials: Creating and Interacting with Smart Contracts

Learn how to create and interact with a smart contract using Alchemy:

### Hello World Contract
- [Hello World Smart Contract](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/hello-world-smart-contract)

#### Topics
- Alchemy Composer Tool for invoking some methods on blockchain explorer
- Install Node.js/npm and Hardhat for smart contract development


- Build and deploy a simple "Hello World" smart contract using Hardhat:

   - Develop the contract
   - dotenv, metamask setup, metamask private key and AlChemy API key
   - EthersJS
   - Deploy the contract on a local or test Ethereum network
   - Interact with the deployed smart contract
   - Submit the smart contract to Etherscan for verification

### Storage, Memory, and Calldata

Distinguish between different data locations in Solidity

- **Storage**: Persistent storage on the Ethereum blockchain
- **Memory**: Temporary storage during function execution
- **Calldata**: Special data location containing function arguments from external calls

### Events in Solidity

- How are events emitted and consumeed?
- Learn what events are and how they are defined
- Understand how events can be emitted and captured
- Use events to log important contract interactions and state changes

### Mapping and Arrays in Solidity
